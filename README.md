    REQUIREMENTS:

    To play MV:EI, you will need a Macintosh running OS9 or OSX, and Apple's Quicktime. A reasonably fast CPU (400Mhz+) and some RAM is also recommended.

    MAKE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that you play the game in either 256 or Thousands of colors. Millions will make the game run so slow it's not even funny. 256 colors is by far the fastest, so we recommend that highly.

    It is also strongly recommended that you have a human being (preferably alive) sitting at the computer to play the game.

    To view the gameplay movie, you will need Apple's Quicktime. (Yes, I did lose to the boss... I don't want to give away our ending!!!)

    Quicktime can be found at http://www.apple.com/quicktime/

    GAMEPLAY:

    When the game begins, a title screen will appear. You can push any button to start the game. From there, use 4,5,6,and 8 on the numeric keypad to move, and Z to shoot. You can push Q to quit the game. From the GAME OVER screen, any button will quit the game.

    The stone heads do not move, but can hurt if you hit them. They are worth 50 points.

    The green enemies simply fly at you kamikaze style. They are worth 250 points.

    The skulls shoot at you. They are worth 450 points.

    The voodoo masks also shoot at you, and are worth 600 points.

    Finally, the (extremely difficult, but beatable) boss is worth 10,000 points.

    TROUBLESHOOTING:

    First, NEVER touch any of the files in the "Data" folder. If you do, you will probably screw the game over pretty badly.

    Second, if you get crashes or sluggish gameplay, increase the game's RAM. Make sure you are playing in 256 or Thousands of colors.

    If you have further problems... I can't help you. All the known problems have been fixed... ^_^

    NEM42'S THANKS:

    First, I'd like to thank God for allowing me to get enough sleep during this contest!

    Major props to Albinogul, even though he joined us late, without him the project never would have finished. He made sounds and music, drew, beta tested, and offered some great input.

    Thanks to Silvir for all the stone heads. He gave the game the style that it has, even though he could only put 1 day into the project.

    I'd also like to thank Dan Potter and Roddy Toomim of Cryptic Allusions (http://www.cagames.com/) for making an excellent Dance Dance Revolution clone so I could take breaks from coding, and keep my brain intact.

    In short, I'm amazed at what we accomplished, since Silver could only work for one day, Alb came in late, and I had various things to do over the weekend. I put about 14 hours into the game, personally.

    MV:EI is 100% coded in MetaL (http://www.iit.edu/~sarimar/GDS/), which is essentially BASIC. The primary code was 538 lines, and the enemy scripting an additional 50. Maybe sometime I'll recode it for Windows.

    The gameplay movie was recorded with Snapz Pro X (http://www.ambrosiaSW.com/).

    Thanks for playing our game. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.
